# 007: Two Sum
#
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
# return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
# 
# You may assume that each input has exactly one solution,
# and you may not use the same element twice.
# 
# Return the answer as a list of two indices.
# The order does not matter.
