# 016: Longest Consecutive Sequence
#
# You are given an unsorted list of integers nums.
# Return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
# 
# You must solve it in O(n) time.
# No sorting allowed.
# You must use O(n) time.
# Do not use the same number twice.
# Duplicates may exist, but they donâ€™t count toward the sequence.
